Grief is a natural response to loss, and understanding its stages can help us process our emotions more effectively. While everyone experiences grief differently, there are common patterns that many people share.

## The Five Stages of Grief

### 1. Denial
The first stage often involves disbelief and shock. This is our mind's way of protecting us from overwhelming emotions.

### 2. Anger
As reality sets in, we might feel angry at the situation, others, or even ourselves. This anger is a natural part of the healing process.

### 3. Bargaining
During this stage, we often find ourselves thinking "what if" and "if only." This is our attempt to regain control over the situation.

### 4. Depression
This stage involves deep sadness and withdrawal. It's important to remember that this is a natural response to loss.

### 5. Acceptance
Eventually, we begin to accept our new reality. This doesn't mean we're "over it," but rather that we're learning to live with our loss.

## Getting Support

Remember that grief is not linear, and you may move back and forth between these stages. It's essential to:

- Seek support from family and friends
- Consider joining a grief support group
- Talk to a professional counselor when needed
- Take care of your physical health
- Be patient with yourself
